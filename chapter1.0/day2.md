### What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
- Safety and Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

### In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

#### 1. Safety and Security
This is vital as the crypto and blockchain space is notorious for hacks and exploits which occur on an almost weekly basis. In some cases this can result in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars as in the example of the recent Axie Infinity hack on their dedicated "Ronin" blockchain. 

These major security breaches are bad for the reputation and progress of the crypto industry. Anything which can dramatically mitigate these problems is a net positve for the crypto space as a whole. 

#### 2. Clarity
Code readability is also important to promote collaboration between developers and make it easier for members of the community to check that the code is "doing what it says it does". Improved readibility can also reduce the type of complexity found in Solidity contracts which can lead to bugs and opportunities for hackers to find exploits. 

#### 3. Approachability
Using similar syntax and concepts to traditional web2 programming where possible (like functions and types) will make it easier to onboard more developers into web3. The more builders, the easier and faster it will be to develop more Dapps and spur innovation.

#### 4. Developer Experience
Once web2 developers are intrigued and start experimenting with blockchains like Flow, it is also important to make the tools for debugging easy to use. Programming by its very nature is hard and can be very frustrating when things simply do not work and there is not a clear reason why. Clarity on error messages can go a long way to making the whole experience feel more painless. 

#### 5. Resource Oriented Programming

Will give this one a go even though it's not required! I actually already briefly read abut this in Packy McCormick's deep dive on the Flow ecosystem called: "Flow: the Normie Blockchain". This essay also had a major influence on me when deciding which blockchain would be the best one for me to start exploring the possibility of building in web3. 

The key take-away for me on resource-oriented programming is that uniquely, "money is its own data type". This makes it much easier to write secure smart contract code, which reduces mistakes and bugs in the code, therefore preventing catastrophic loss of users' funds.
