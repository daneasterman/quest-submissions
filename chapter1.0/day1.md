### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words

A blockchain is a public database which is distributed and decentralised, usually across many computers around the world. Blockchains allow anyone to store data or perform actions via smart contracts in a permisionless manner and without the approval of any third party.

### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.
A smart contract is essentially a computer program or a set of rules and programming logic which operates on the blockchain to execute almost any kind of functionality. Once a smart contract is "uploaded" or "deployed" to the blockchain's mainnnet, in theory it will exist there autonomously and forever. 

### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction
- A transaction is when a call is made to a function in your smart contract. In other words, whena function is executed to perform some action and data is changed on the blockchain. This almost always has a gas fee associated with it (unless it is subsidised in the case of some Dapps on Flow).
- A script on the hand  is used to view data on the blockchain and does not call any functions which cause data to be changed. It does not cost any gas fees to use scripts as it be seen as similar to a read-only action in traditional programming.
