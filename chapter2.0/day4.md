### 1. Deploy a new contract that has a Struct of your choosing inside of it (must be different than Profile).

### 2. Create a dictionary or array that contains the Struct you defined.

### 3. Create a function to add to that array/dictionary.

### 4. Add a transaction to call that function in step 3.

### 5. Add a script to read the Struct you defined.

Here I just read the first 0 indexed item in the array since I have created the teams data structure as an array rather than a dictionary. I was able to read the Brooklyn Nets Team I added with this approach. However a dictionary data structure is probably easier to get specific items by key in a real-world setting.
